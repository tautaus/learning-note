## How It Changes the Way We Code

Before C++ 11, the code can be quite long. For example, suppose we have a `std::vector<std::vector<int> >`, a vector of vector of int, we cannot write two `>` together because it would be recognized as a right shift operator. We also cannot use `auto` to replace the declaration of types with long name such as `std::vector<std::vector<int> >::iteratior`. The initialzation of the vector could also be troublesome as we don't have list initialization.
