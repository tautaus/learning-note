# C++ 20

After the publish of C++ 20, the size of community grows significantly. 

## How It Changes the Way We Code

Before C++ 11, the code can be quite long. For example, suppose we have a `std::vector<std::vector<int> >`, a vector of vector of int, we cannot write two `>` together because it would be recognized as a right shift operator. We also cannot use `auto` to replace the declaration of types with long name such as `std::vector<std::vector<int> >::iteratior`. The initialzation of the vector could also be troublesome as we don't have list initialization.

### Coroutines

Coroutines are computer program components that generalize subroutines for non-preemptive multitasking, by allowing execution to be suspended and resumed.

In C++ 20, there is a new `yield` feature that remembers the state of the function and gets back the caller code. The function will be paused until it is called again. That would save us the space for static variable and allow access to it by a while loop with yield. For example, `while(true) yield i++;` will return a incremental series when function is called.
