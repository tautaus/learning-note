# Lambda

Lambda calculus is a branch of mathematics for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution. In other words, it focuses on if a problem can be solved by a tuning machine or not. It was introduced in 1930s and the usage of computer was very limited. In lambda calculus, the greek letter lambda $lambda$ was used to define the function without a name.
